### About me

I am an Electronic Engineer and I have 1.5 years of experience working in software development with Python and in the area of automation and control. Once I finished my university studies, I began to train as a Data Scientist. I took an IBM Data Science course and complemented this knowledge with other SQL, PySpark and Machine Learning courses.

I really like challenges and I have a lot of desire and energy to continue learning and growing both personally and professionally. I am currently looking for my first work experience as a Jr Data Scientist.
